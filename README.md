The purpose of this challenge is to create a webpage and dynamic table to provide in-dept analysis of UFO sightings.  The table is able to be filtered by users through multiple criteria.

## Summary

With the growing number of people that are interested in UFO sightings this is a great interactive webpage.  One drawback to this site is that the table of sightings is only for 2010.  There are so many years of sightings that could be added to this table.  Sightings from all over the world could also be added to this table and an all emcompassing table of UFO sightings.
